	This module adds a ‘Blacklist’ category to partners. If a customer or supplier is set in this category, then it appears in red in the partners list.
    You can also add warnings on some objects (i.e. Sales Order) in order to inform the user that the partner he is trying to use is on the blacklist, and why.
